Vehicles are excellent at Free of  Fire and have advantages such as being able to quickly navigate the map or cut other players in open terrain, but there are also some important negative aspects. Vehicles obviously limit their ability to deal immediately with the enemy, can be heard from far away and are an easy target if unconsciously directed to an enemy ambush."},

    "body": "It depends on the preferences of the players and veterans of the real battle, I am sure that you have found a style of play that suits you, however, I advise you to step back, your comfort zone and try some something new for all beginners to fight, here are some effective styles for which you should have an idea.
Guns burning
Everyone likes to scream. With inflamed weapons, you'll end up using fallen enemies, and it's a great tactic, especially if you're part of a group. Running against an enemy can be a great way to overwhelm you unexpectedly, if your group knows how to play better together. With this style of play, flanking is crucial, it is essential to get a good angle from your enemy to ensure victory. This may not be the best single-player game because you do not have a backup and it will be easier for enemy players to follow your moves."},

    "body": "This is for all heart snipers. If you see an enemy player in Free of Fire, stay close, stay out of sight and commit to the best possible opportunity, usually when you collect equipment. It is an excellent style of play for duets and solos. Minimize the risks for you while you get the Alive countdown one by one. The ideal is to commit to distance to be able to closely monitor nearby enemies. Working as a team will be easier because you can expand in several fields of vision. Single players should seek coverage and participate from inside / near the deck to reduce their visibility to those around them.
survivalist
A game style that is perfect for all beginners of the real battle genre. Avoid fights at all costs and persist until the end, only kill 1 person to win. Participating in a single enemy unit is always preferable to many fighters.
While this does not seem to be the most fun game style, it will certainly help you reach the last 5 finals and give you time to get used to the mechanics of the game. Once you have an idea of ​​how the game is played, start fighting and take part in some additional battles to win this crucial fighting experience. Remember that your reward at the end of each match is directly related to your performance in the match. As a result, more casualties, more loot!" },

    "published_date": "2019-03-19T00:00:00.000Z",
    "body": "While some firearms seem to be guaranteed as players' killing machines, it's really great to play. For those looking for a close combat on the ground, a shotgun and an SMG combo / assault rifle can never fail. The devastating damage caused by a low caliber 12-gauge explosion will damage the armor and the health of the enemy. Combine it with a high SMG firing rate and you will accumulate losses, the main disadvantage of this association is the higher recharge rate of the shotgun. Give yourself time to recharge, seeking refuge after each commitment.

For those looking to eliminate other players from a distance, snipers and assault rifles are always winners. Our favorite personal combination and the best recommendation to reach the first place: a long-range sniper, such as SCAR or AK's kar98k, can really dominate a battle. Hitting players from all over the field will confuse them and cause panic if you do not eliminate them with some quick shots in the head.
Survivors may prefer to follow with an assault rifle and combined SMG, spray and prey that maybe are not the most elegant fighting style, but can be very effective.
If you play duo or group, spread the weapons. Variety is the salt of life and being able to adapt quickly will give you an advantage over others on the battlefield." },

An armored player with a level 3 assault rifle should not really be random, combine it with medical kits whenever he has the chance and almost certainly win against each one.
The armor is damaged over time, however, a level 3 with poor health protects a shot more damaging than the level 2 armor. Do not negotiate that when you reach the last 10-15% of sustainability, even in this case , the risk of exploring new sources of level 3 can be profitable."},

Play against the edge of the circle. If you are constantly moving your back to the circle, you know that you are safe in your 6. The circle may be the best forward. Limiting the directions in which enemies can attack you is perhaps the most useful technique you can find when you play Free of Fire or any Royal Battle game. Even if enemy players find themselves knitting in blue, you will have a superior advantage, because once they have healed, blue will end their health bar. I love the circle. " },

Gun ammunition is okay if you have small amounts, but most of the time, you will spend all of your time without using your gun. This applies to all weapons that you have not yet equipped.
The ammunition is abundant, you can find it in the bodies, in the buildings or in your ammunition boxes at the beginning of the game. You can also apply this principle to the grenades. The number of times you die trying to kill this impressive grenade is not worth it. The first aid kits and ammunition are their main priority, more murders and more care. Use it or lose it, it is always good to take it into account." },
